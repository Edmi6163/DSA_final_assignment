\section{Skip List implementation}
\subsection{Introduction}
The purpose of this chapter is to report the tests that have been done to find the best value of \underline{height} in a Skip List.
Skip List is a probabilistic data structure that allows searching, insertion and deleting operation with time complexity of $O(log n)$.

\subsection{Testing methodology\footnote{all test are done on a Lenovo Thinkpad x390 yoga with an Intel Core i7-8565U CPU and 16GB of RAM, with Arch Linux installed as only OS}}
I wrote a python script that runs the program with different values of \underline{height} and saves the output in a file, the range of tested level is between 6 and 50

  % Add your data points here
  % The 'nan' values indicate that the algorithm did not terminate for those max_height values

    (0.000143,12)
    % Add more data points and 'nan' as needed
  };

Range from 1 to 5 is omitted because the algorithm did not terminate for those values
