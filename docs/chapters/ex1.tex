\section{Mege Binary Insertion Sort implementation}
\subsection{Introduction}
The purpose of this report is to provide the tests that have been done to find the best value of K for the Merge Binary Insertion Sort algorithm.
Considering that Merge Binary Insertion Sort is a hybrid algorithm that has ability to handle large input and for its speed, but it became inefficient when having a small input, in the case of small input the library switch to Binary Insertion sort, that is more efficient on small input.

\subsection{Testing methodolgy}
